Pargas Gaming Community rf (inofficially PGC) is an association founded 2014 with the goals to promote and develope the interest
 for information and communication technology as a hobby and freetime occupation. The association arranges and supports LAN 
 events as well as other forms of IT and computer games related leisure activities. 

PGC as an association has grown a lot in just a few years and we would like to become even more involved in the e-sports scene.
We have seen that there is interest in the e-sports scene and therefore PGC has started hosting leagues within competitive 
games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Hearthstone.
